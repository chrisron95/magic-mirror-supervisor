# Magic Mirror Supervisor

This is a python script that manages my Magic Mirror.

The Magic Mirror is a 42" TV with mirror glass on the front, and has an IR touch overlay which makes it a touchscreen. There are also 3 buttons on the side for whatever I'd like.

A Raspberry Pi runs it all, I have the actual [MagicMirror2](https://magicmirror.builders/) software installed, but I prefer to run a chromium kiosk browser with a Home Assistant dashboard.
